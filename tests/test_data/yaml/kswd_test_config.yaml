    # Make sure that the user your are loggin in with this script can access the filter.
    # Uncomment if you want to use this YAML file to define your filter by
    # defining project keys, issue types, and dates.
    # Please be aware that the "Max Results" attribute is always valid,
    # also when using a filter.
    #Filter: My Example Filter
    # Specify a list of projects instead of using a filter.
    # Obsolete if a filter is defined.
    Projects:
        - KSWD # Kanban Software Development
    # Restrict the search result to the given issue types.
    # Obsolete if a filter is defined.
    Issue Types:
        - Story
        - Task
        - Bug
    # Exclude issues created before the following date, YYYY-MM-DD
    # Obsolete if a filter is defined.
    Exclude Created Date: 2024-01-01
    # Exclude issues resolved before the following date, YYYY-MM-DD
    # Obsolete if a filter is defined.
    Exclude Resolved Date: 2024-01-01
    # Define the maximum amount of returned search results.
    # If not set, the default value is 100.
    # Also used when a filter is defined.
